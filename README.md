# Codevita-Q
Partial solution for the question **coordinates of a folded paper** appeared in Codevita S11

At the time when I wrote the solution I could not find the question, It also had a detail of printing or returning the coordinates n clockwise order.
But I wasn't sure so that's why 'partial'.
